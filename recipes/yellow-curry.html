    <h3>Better Than Take-out</h3>
    <p>I feel like I have a duty to make sure people know how easy some of their favorite International foods are to make from home! We’re talking fridge to table in about 30 minutes! If you love “better than take-out” recipes as much as I do then you should definitely take a peak at my favorite Thai, Chinese, and Korean recipes.</p>
    <h3>11 Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>2 tsp peanut oil</li>
        <li>2 red onions, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (100g) Thai yellow curry paste</li>
        <li>270ml coconut cream</li>
        <li>300g snow peas, ends trimmed, halved diagonally</li>
        <li>2 tbsp lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coriander leaves</li>
        <li>Steamed jasmine rice, to serve</li>
        <li>Lime wedges, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3 Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a wok over high heat. Add onion and stir-fry for 2 mins or until lightly browned. Add curry paste and stir-fry for 1 min or until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Stir in coconut cream and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium low. Add fish and snow peas. Cook, gently stirring occasionally, for 5 mins or until the fish and snow peas are just cooked through. Remove from heat. Stir in lime juice, sugar and fish sauce. Season with more lime juice, sugar or fish sauce, if desired.</li>
            <li>Divide the curry among serving bowls. Sprinkle with coriander leaves. Serve with steamed rice and lime wedges.</li>
        </ol>
