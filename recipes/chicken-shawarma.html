    <h1>Chicken Shawarma</h1>
    <h3>Try and <em>wrap</em> your mind around this!</h3>
        <p>The simple idea of meat wrapped in flatbread appears among cultures all around the globe. From Indian curries wrapped in naan, to Mexican tacos al pastor and Middle Eastern shawarma rolls. Greece’s contribution to this heavenly meat-encased-in-carb world is yiros. Sometimes spelt gyros, yiros refers to meat, usually chicken, skewered onto a vertical rotisserie grill cooked to golden perfection. It’s then shaved and stacked into warm and fluffy pita bread with – wait for it – chips! That’s right, crunchy golden chunks of fried potatoes. </p>
